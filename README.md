# Title: Developing a Web-Based Image-Enabled Fraud Prevention Relationship Rating Platform for Enhanced Trust and Safety in Interpersonal Encounters

# Abstract: This research aims to design and develop a web-based platform that integrates image recognition technology with a rating and review system, allowing users to assess and rate individuals they encounter in various interpersonal settings, with a specific focus on fraud prevention. The platform will utilize user-generated data, machine learning algorithms, and image recognition techniques to identify potential fraudsters and promote safer interactions. By incorporating image recognition capabilities, the platform will provide users with an additional layer of information to evaluate the credibility and trustworthiness of individuals. The study will involve user surveys, data analysis, algorithm development, and image recognition model training to create an effective fraud prevention relationship profile system.
